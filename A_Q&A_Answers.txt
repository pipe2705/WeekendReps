A. Q + A

1- How do we assign a value to a variable?
	
	We assign a value to a variable by using the "=" sign. 

2-How do we change the value of a variable?

	 We can change the value by reassigning it a new value after the "=" or by using an operator to change the value. 
		
3- How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?

	let oldVariable = 5;
	let newVariable = oldVariable;

	we can state the existing variable as the value of the new variable ie. "new variable" = "existing variable"

4- Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
	
	They are the 3 required components for creating a variable. 
	declare (what are we declaring? ie. var, let, const)
	Assignment is the storing of a value to a variable.
	Define is the value that we are stating or wanting that declaration to be named. 

5- What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
	
	It is the process of writting out the necessary steps to accomplish a certain goal in human understandable language.
	You can then take this pseudocode and write actual code to execute. 

6- What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
	
	I think this is an "it depends" kind of answer. But generally you want to spend a lot of time thinking about the problem you're trying to solve or task you're trying to accomplish before you commit to writing code. But it depends on experience level, 
	and the specific task at hand.
